## Javascript Projects
I completed some of these projects while studying javascript on freeCodeCamp.
#### Palindrome Checker [View Code](https://github.com/jenniferobidike/Javascript-Projects/blob/master/palindromeChecker.js):
This code returns true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false. A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. I made sure to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for the palindromes.
#### Roman Numeral Converter [View Code](https://github.com/jenniferobidike/Javascript-Projects/blob/master/romanNumeralConverter.js):
This code converts any given number into Roman numeraland returns it in uppercase.
#### Ceasars Cipher [View Code](https://github.com/jenniferobidike/Javascript-Projects/blob/master/ceasarsCipher.js):
In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount. I wrote a function for the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
The function takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. All letters will be retured in uppercase and all non-alphabetic characters passed on as it is.
#### Telephone Number Validator [View Code](https://github.com/jenniferobidike/Javascript-Projects/blob/master/telephoneNumberValidator.js):
For this challenge, I was presented with a string such as5555555555, 1 555 555 5555, 800-692-7753, or 8oo-six427676;laskdjf. I used Regex to validate or reject the US phone number based on any combination of the formats provided. I ensured to return true if the string is a valid US phone number of false.
#### Cash Register [View Code](https://github.com/jenniferobidike/Javascript-Projects/blob/master/cashRegister.js):
I wroted a function for a cash register drawer, function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument. 
The function always returned an object with a status key and a change key.
